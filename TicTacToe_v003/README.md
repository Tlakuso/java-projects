Java program for a simple implementation of the classic game "Tic Tac Toe" with a graphical user interface (GUI). Here's a brief explanation of the key components and functionality:

Initialization: The program initializes a JFrame (window) to create the game's GUI. It sets the size, title, background color, and layout of the JFrame.

User Interface Elements:

title_panel: This panel contains a JLabel to display the title "Tic-Tac-Toe." score_panel: This panel displays the scores for both players (X and O). button_panel: This panel holds a 3x3 grid of JButton components for the game board. reset_button and exit_button: These buttons allow users to reset the game and exit the application. Player Turns: The TheGame class manages player turns. It randomly selects which player starts the game (either X or O).

Event Handling: The class implements the ActionListener interface to handle button click events. The actionPerformed method is called when a button is clicked.

Game Logic:

Players take turns clicking on the buttons to place their symbol (X or O) on the board. The check method is used to check for win conditions. It verifies if a player has won by checking rows, columns, and diagonals. If there is a winner, the xWins or oWins methods are called to highlight the winning combination and disable further moves. The isWinner method checks if a player (X or O) has won based on the current board state. Scores: The program keeps track of scores for both players and updates them when there's a winner.

Reset and Exit: Users can reset the game or exit the application using the corresponding buttons.

Overall, this Java program provides a graphical representation of the Tic Tac Toe game, allowing two players to take turns and keeping track of their scores. It demonstrates basic GUI elements, event handling, and game logic. The code follows a simple structure and can serve as a starting point for building more sophisticated versions of the game.
